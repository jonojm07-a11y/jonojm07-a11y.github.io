## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 2 Part 1: I really enjoyed this lab as it was one of the first ones and was a good introduction to what Comp Sci 120L was going to be about. It was simple to learn and was a fun little learning experience for me and my two teammates Devon and Daniel who I later became friends with because of this lab!

Lab 5 Part 1:  This is another good lab that taught me how to overcome difficult tasks. My teammate Anthony was the perfect partner as he walked me through every part I didn’t understand. Overall, it was a really interesting lab that involved all the things I learned prior inside the Lecture portion of the class.

Lab 8 Part 2: Lab 8 was my favorite lab by far because of the material. I love how it was a good challenge that involved multiple for loops involving a pattern. It was an easy task that was fun to do with my partner Andrew who was awesome might I add. Ever since this part of lab 8, I have been waiting for another lab like it!
