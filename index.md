## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 2, Part 1: 
   
    I really enjoyed this lab as it was one of the first ones and was a good introduction to what Comp Sci 120L was going to be about. It was simple to learn and was a fun little learning experience for me and my two teammates Devon and Daniel. This lab allowed me to create two awesome friendships with these two who I could collaborate withh in future labs.

* Lab 5, Part 1: 
    
     This is another good lab that taught me how to overcome difficult tasks. My teammate Anthony was the perfect partner as he walked me through every part I did not understand. Overall, it was a really interesting lab that involved all the things I learned prior inside the Lecture portion of the class.

* Lab 8, Part 2: 
   
    Lab 8 was my favorite lab by far because of the material. I love how it was a good challenge that involved multiple for loops involving a pattern. It was an easy task that was fun to do with my partner Andrew who was awesome might I add. Ever since this part of lab 8, I have been waiting for another lab like it!
